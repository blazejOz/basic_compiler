1. Lexical analysis
    Lexer - generate tokens from soruce code
    best use regex - simplest

2. syntax_analysis
    Parser - generate AST(abstract syntax tree based on EBNF) 
    create ast_classes with all AST designs

3. Semantic Analysys - checks AST for semantic errors


4.Intermediete Representation
    IR - genereate TAC(three address code) with quadruple structure:
        Quadruple: It is a structure which consists of 4 fields namely op, arg1, arg2 and result. 
        op denotes the operator and arg1 and arg2 denotes the two operands and result is used to store 
        the result of the expression. (from GeeksForGeeks)

5. IR optimization: 
    1. Constant folding - calculate expressions used by consttantts
    2. Remove dead code  - remve code that is not used in any arguments

5. Code Gererator:
    generate assembly(x86-64 AMD) code using libc library - 
    translation of IR instructions to asm code.
    need to manage registires...
